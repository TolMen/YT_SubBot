## Description  

- **YT_SubBot** is a script designed to automate the creation of Google accounts to subscribe to a YouTube channel.  
- This project was created for experimental purposes and **is not complete** due to a captcha blockage.  
- It is just a personal test, with no professional or malicious intent.  

## Process  

Here are the steps currently supported by the bot:  

1. **Opening the browsers**  
   - Opens two Chrome windows :  
     - One with a temporary email service.  
     - The other with the Google sign-up page.  

2. **Filling out the sign-up form**  
   - Step 1 : Fills in the first name.  
   - Step 2 : Fills in the date of birth and gender.  

3. **Managing the temporary email**  
   - Copies the temporary email address and pastes it into the form.  
   - Retrieves the confirmation code sent to the temporary email.  

4. **Account validation**  
   - Step 4 : Fills in the confirmation code.  
   - Step 5 : Sets a password.  

5. **Program termination**  
   - The bot stops at step 6 (Captcha validation), preventing the completion of the registration.
